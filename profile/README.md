## Crafting a future for traditional tabletop RPG assets

Everlore aims to bring new possibilities to traditional tabletop role-playing games by turning their core elements—characters, items, stories, and worlds—into reusable crypto-assets. Everlore hopes to let these virtual assets live beyond their original tabletop sessions, adding to a growing, shared fantasy lore. The project is under development, with plans for open-source, freely available decentralized applications (first for Windows, later for Linux, and Mac) to create and manage these assets.

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives
- **Perdurability**: Ensure tabletop RPG assets persist beyond individual games, maintaining their value and significance.
- **Traceability**: Provide a chronological record of each asset’s events, enhancing its narrative and historical value.
- **Ownership**: Grant creators true ownership of their stories as crypto-assets on the blockchain.

### What Everlore Wants to Be
The best adventures are not always found on the shelves of your favorite game store. Great stories, fantastic worlds brimming with epic moments, and plots full of clever twists have been lost in the darkness of a drawer stuffed with papers. Everlore aims to function as a decentralized network of connected creatives—both game masters and players—where creative energy flows freely, making it easy not only to share stories, but also to actively participate in them.

### What Everlore Does NOT Want to Be
Everlore will never, under any circumstances, become a marketplace for collectible NFTs like “magic swords” or “level-10 characters.” Tabletop role-playing is a creative and collaborative hobby, and fostering creativity and collaboration does not require adding an artificial layer of scarcity just to charge for virtual resources. Instead, Everlore will be built on decentralized, open-source software that connects the player community peer-to-peer (P2P) without the intervention of any external authority. Blockchain technology will be used solely to achieve the goals mentioned above: durability, traceability, and true ownership for creators.

The sharing and participation in stories will be free and subject only to the conditions set by the authors themselves, who may choose to accept collaborations or retain full creative control, as well as decide the terms of use.
